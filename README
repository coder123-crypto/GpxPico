Some very small utils for processing with GPX files for my personal using.

GpxTrimmer:
	GpxTrimmer remove all additional data in GPX file except
	longitude, latitude, time and elevation. Old file saving to backup.
	GpxTrimmer is supported wildcard in file, i.g. '*.gpx', '2019.09.??.gpx', etc.

	Usage: python gpxtrimmer.py file

GpxJoiner:
   	GpxJoiner join all segments from some files in one.
	Hint: this file will trimmed as after GpxTrimmer.

	Usage: python gpxjoiner.py file1.gpx file2.gpx... fileN.gpx destination.gpx
